4/29/2002 - Inserted code to insert KPIA as the forecast city for KBMI as a NWS forecast
does not exisit for KBMI.

3/26/2002 - 
Inspired again.  Working to move all static images to DB.  Created openweather_blobimg.pl.
Perhaps I will attempt this at a later date.

3/25/2002 - 
Thanks to David Kirol (d.kirol@attbi.com) for his efforts 
with MySQL and BLOBs.

1/8/2002 - 
Added "arial.ttf" for Image::Magick.

1/7/2002 - 
Fixed openweather_cycle.pl failure to aquire 00Z cycle.

1/6/2002 -
Version 0.21 released.  Enjoy!

1/5/2002 - 
Modified legend.gif to cover the NOAA DBZ legend.  For some reason using Win32 
I can't composite an image with Image::Magick if it's white (#FFFFFF).  Metric selection 
only appears when you've selected an ICAO.

1/3/2002 - 
Allowed removal of header and footer in config.

12/30/2001 - 
Created new weather condition images.

12/29/2001 - 
Allowed second command line option for openweather_nexrad.pl.  
Example: openweather_nexrad.pl DS.p20-r KESX.

12/26/2001 - 
Moved flags to images/flags directory.

12/18/2001 - 
Happy birthday, Perl.  You beautiful bastard.

12/16/2001 - 
At long last, international support!  A main page tab titled "International" 
has been included.  Will list every country in the si table.  I don't really like the looks 
of this section yet, perhaps a face lift later.

12/15/2001 - 
Migrated development to Win32.  Aside from modifying the first line of the file 
from '#!/usr/bin/perl' to '#!E:\Perl\bin\perl.exe' nothing was changed.

12/14/2001 - 
Halted web site and mail-list.

12/13/2001 - 
Added support for international sites (ICAO query only at this time).

12/12/2001 - 
Removed trends section.  Fixed negative temperatures in openweather_mrtg.pl.  
Removed automatic cycle - 1 feature in get_cycle().  site_query() will now attempt to query 
current cycle, and fall back to previous_cycle() if no current cycle exists.  In the event 
no current or previous cycle is found, the standard "no cycle found" error message will be 
displayed.  Moved filler.gif from 'nexrad' to 'images' directory.

12/11/2001 - 
Added openweather_mrtg.pl into the mix.  MRTG has returned to the project!  
Currently supporting temperature output only.

12/10/2001 - 
Moved weather condition images into images/conditions.  Completed "NEXRAD Locations" 
image map.  New logo.gif, behold the glory of lens flare!  See what happens when you put PhotoShop 
into the hands of someone like myself?  Added DS.78ohp (1hr rainfall totals) into NEXRAD sites.

12/9/2001 - 
Split out all user configurable vars into openweather.cfg, added README, INSTALL, and 
CHANGELOG.  Thanks to Don "Duck" Harper (duck@duckland.org) for his work on this.  Sorting Zip Code 
searches based on distance now, additional table "distance_temp" required.  See openweather.sql for 
more information.  Refined metric conversions.

12/8/2001 - 
Added "NEXRAD Locations" tab to main page.  Will finish image map at a later date.

12/6/2001 - 
Version 0.20 released.  Included support for the metric system.  Added snazzy state flags.  
Corrected database errors in openweather_nexrad.pl.

12/4/2001 - 
Version 0.19.1 released.  Corrected temperature conversions.  Included support for negative 
temperature values.

12/2/2001 - 
Version 0.19 released.  Finalized many cosmetic details.  Forecast section complete.  Support 
for Canada, Alaska, and Hawaii.

11/18/2001 - 
Looking for assistance in developing a common configuration mechanism and Microsoft SQL server 
support.  Could also use some Q&A type support in the way of verification, cleanup, etc.  Please subscribe 
to the mailing list if you would like to participate!

11/12/2001 - 
Version 0.18 released.

11/11/2001 - 
Formally changed project name from "Weather Fetch" to "Open Weather".  It would seem countless 
multitudes of neophytes have already named their obscure projects "Weather Fetch".

10/16/2001 - 
Version 0.17 released.  Included forecast functionality.  Included composite image.

9/28/2001 - 
Version 0.16 released.  I'm primarily releasing this due to many requests for various fixes.
This release corrects weather condition inaccuracies.  Many new cosmetic features incorporated in wfetch.css.  
There is an outstanding issue with heat index and wind chill calculations.  Get on the mail list and help!  
Image::Magick is now required in wfetch_nexrad.pl.

9/20/2001 - 
Created mail list!  Send email to openweather-request@riven.net.  If you're interested in this 
project, or have questions, subscribe.

8/31/2001 - Version 0.15 released.  Included graphing support.  MRTG is no longer supported.  I've decided 
for graphing purposes to use the GD Perl modules.  If you wish to get your hands on the old MRTG code, look 
into v0.14 or the legacy software.  How you graph the information is really arbitrary.

8/25/2001 - 
Version 0.14 released.  Included support for animated NEXRAD imagery.  Incorporated new look and 
feel into the script, looks rather slick now.  Use of wfetch_query.html no longer required, script generates 
it's on user selection page.

8/23/2001 - 
As you can tell, this project has undergone a major face-lift.  I'm now focusing my efforts on a 
much more robust weather gathering system.  The latest release brings SQL into the mix.

8/8/2001 -
Version 0.12.11 released.  Included are wfetch_gather v0.2 and wfetch_graph v0.2.  Weather Fetch now utilizes 
two separate, yet equally important scripts.  Wfetch_gather attempts to retrieve a METAR decode for the specified 
site code, while wfetch_graph is called from MRTG and prepares the selected information.  An updated MRTG config 
example can be found on this page.  A third script, wfetch_report is in the works.  It will query the latest 
decode and prepare a customizable HTML page. 

8/7/2001 -

Version 0.12.8 released.  Be warned, this is still new stuff.  Use at your own risk.  Included support for a debug 
switch, nothing as a user defined output, and a HTML report section.            

8/6/2001 -
Version 0.12.6 released.  Be warned, this is still new stuff.  Use at your own risk.  Included support for user 
defined output.

8/5/2001 -
Working to include user defined output (i.e. temperature, wind speed, etc.).  Version 0.12.2 released.  Be warned, 
this is new stuff.  Experiment at your own risk.  Removed Net:: FTP support (fails more times than it’s useful).  
Attempting to move away from flat files in place of arrays.  A version with complete use of SQL is still in the works.

7/29/2001 -
Version 0.11 released.  Added support for LWP::UserAgent and the use of HTTP transfers.

7/21/2001 -
Working to add SQL support into history.  Introduced correct version conventions.

7/14/2001 -
Version 0.9 released.  Removed need for wget.  Station information is now retrieved using the Net::FTP module.

7/11/2001 -
Version 0.8 released.  Added increased history flexibility.  Converted standalone history into a subroutine.  
The decision whether or not to process a station dump is now determined by the size of the file (i.e. if unable 
to download it will create 0 byte file).  Thank you to Michael Teator for the light bulb on null files.  I’m 
considering whether or not to fetch the file via a self developed module or take Michael’s suggestion on ncftpget.  
Working on version 0.8 and have noticed something.  Adjusting the wget “tries” switch to at least 10 has shown better 
results.  Planning to make this default in next release.  Attempting to write error handling for the wget section 
(i.e. fetch section).  I have yet to isolate the problem.  It seems every now and then when running the script no 
information is returned.  I’m welcoming any suggestions.Version 0.6 released.  Included major error handling 
improvements.  Before a station file is fetched, the script attempts to send a TCP “ping” and ICMP_ECHO_REQUEST.  
Based on the return of these, either the script will continue to process the information or refer to its history.  
Ah yes, history.  After a few packs of cigarettes and digging into the PERL cookbook, a very simple history system 
(enabled by default) has been established.  A file called “history” in your $weather_dir keeps a plain text account 
of all station file transfers and their timestamps.  By setting $keep_history to True (i.e. 1 or for that matter 
anything other than 0 or null) history is enabled.  In the event that the NOAA site cannot be reached, the history 
file will be processed to determine the last valid information.  In the event of failure, the values will be set to 0.

7/10/2001 -
Version 0.4 released.  Added a time stamp to the temporary weather dump file.

7/9/2001 -
Version 0.3 released:  Included support for a temperature of 0.  Version 0.2 released:  Modified output to display 
positive or negative ambient temperature.  Based on the ambient temperature, either a null value followed by a temperature 
is returned or the opposite in case of a negative value.  For example; an ambient temperature of –10 is processed, the 
following is returned: 10,0 where an ambient temperature of 10 is processed, the following is returned: 0,10.

7/1/2001 - 
Project started as Weather Fetch.  A simple MRTG weather solution.
